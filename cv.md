I am a software architect at [Cepton](http://www.cepton.com), where I manage a team designing and implementing lidar perception software. I have extensive experience implementing various algorithms processing point clouds, Kalman filters, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and other algorithms using real robotic hardware. I am a lifelong learner (whether it's learning an [exciting new programming language](http://julialang.org) or [using state of the art sensors](https://www.cepton.com/products.html)), and I love to teach others in an [intuitive way](/2015/10/14/how-i-learn/).

# Skills & Qualifications

**Technical**

* Several years of academic and industry experience designing and implementing lidar-based detection, tracking, classification, and mapping solutions
* Applied knowledge of probabilistic mobile robotics, including guidance (e.g., A\*, D\*), navigation (e.g., EKF, UKF, graph-based SLAM), control (e.g., path-following/tracking, pose stabilization), and perception (e.g., detecting and tracking multiple objects)
* Theoretical and practical experience modelling and using various types of sensors (e.g., lidar, time-of-flight cameras, GPS, IMUs, encoders, magnetometers, SONAR)

**Communication**

* Native English speaker, intermediate French speaker
* Confident public speaker, excellent technical writing skills, winner of multiple teaching awards

**Programming and Computing**

* Several years experience designing and implementing software using C++, including a strong familiarity with modern C++ features (e.g., smart pointers, lambdas, move semantics, etc.)
