I am a Ph.D. candidate at [Queen's university](http://www.queensu.ca) focusing on state estimation in robotics. I have extensive experience implementing Kalman filters, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and other algorithms on real robotic hardware. I am a lifelong learner (whether its learning an [exciting new programming language](http://julialang.org) or [programming state-of-the-art hardware](https://www.google.com/atap/project-tango/)), and I love to teach others in an [intuitive way](/2015/10/14/how-i-learn/).
