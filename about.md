My name is Marc Gallant. I am a PhD candidate at [Queen's University](www.queensu.ca) at the [Mining System Laboratories](https://msl.engineering.queensu.ca) (MSL). My area of study is state estimation in robotics. The image below is an *orientation graph*, which describes how a robot rotates through space and the measurements it makes along the way. I am using orientation graphs to make tools to help geologists and geotechnical engineers safely and efficiently make geotechnical maps. 

The above quote is fortunately not self-referential; rather, it is from [one of my favourite movies](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0128445/). I love playing badminton, shooting darts, drinking craft beer, [trading wool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catan), reading science fiction, and [the Oxford comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma). I am happily married and my wife and I currently expecting our first child and second dog.
