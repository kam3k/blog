My name is Marc Gallant. I like to read and write about robotics, software, science fiction, and teaching. Having spent a lot of time as a student and teacher, I've formed some strong opinions about what teaching methods and tools are effective. (Hint: it isn't sitting through an equation-heavy, clip-art laden, images-overlapping, unironic Comic Sans powerpoint lecture.) Teaching is perhaps what I miss most from my life in academia, so here's hoping this site fills that void. Oh, and sometimes I just post my thoughts and opinions. Deal with it.
