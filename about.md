My name is Marc Gallant. I am a senior software engineer at [Quanergy Systems, Inc.](http://www.quanergy.com), where my field of interest is state estimation in robotics. In September 2016, I completed a Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Queen's University](www.queensu.ca) at the Mining System Laboratory (now [Offroad Robotics](https://offroad.engineering.queensu.ca)). I also have an interest in writing clean, [readable](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9168-programs-must-be-written-for-people-to-read-and-only), and maintainable software.

The image below is an *orientation graph*, which describes how a moving platform rotates through space and the measurements it makes along the way. In my [Ph.D. research](http://qspace.library.queensu.ca/jspui/handle/1974/15025), I used orientation graphs to make tools to help geologists and geotechnical engineers safely and efficiently make geotechnical maps. This work was the basis for a service offered by [RockMass Technologies](https://www.rockmasstech.com/).

The quote at the top of the page is fortunately not self-referential; rather, it is from [one of my favourite movies](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0128445/). I love playing badminton, shooting darts, drinking craft beer, [trading wool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catan), reading science fiction, and [the Oxford comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma). I am happily married and have a beautiful little boy with my wife, Natalie. We also have an orange cat named [Pekoe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_leaf_grading#Orange_pekoe).

I encourage you to check some of [my projects](https://github.com/kam3k), read my [CV](../cv), follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/marcjgallant), or view my [LinkedIn profile](http://ca.linkedin.com/in/marcjgallant). You can contact me at `marc.j.gallant [at] gmail.com`.
